# Python-For-Numerical-Methods
>*Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts.*
## Project Description

### What
This project contains exercices from the Work Sessions. 

### Goals
The main goal of this project is to gain
**insight into the possibilities and limitations of numerical calculations**.

During the exercices we will:
- solve nonlinear equations numerically
- solve linear systems numerically
- numerically derivate and integrate
- approach functions numerically
- solve linear differential equations numerically
- have insight in the numerical solution of partial differential equations

### Personal Goals
Aside this project I also wanted to discover Docker and the containerization.
For this project we used docker to:
- quickly setup python environment and scientific libs
- isolate from main drive
- run spyder as fast as a bare-metal could serve

## Deploy project
This project has been written within spyder in a docker container.
To deploy project we have to install docker and pull the docker image.

### Instructions
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
2. Pull the [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/compdatasci/spyder-desktop)
3. Run the image
4. Open Spyder & run python script

PS: We could also run the py-script directly on computer (with python and sci-modules installed)
    
## Credits 
This is a course at the VUB from the instructors Tim De Troyer, Aurélie Bellemans & Georgios Rekkas Ventiris for 3BA-students in Industrial Engineering.
